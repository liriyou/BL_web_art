    <div> I want to make a website that transmit blessing and comfort. I want to put that website inside my portfolio but not a portfolio page.
        Nowadays, depressing is more like a attitude instead of sickness, people needs others to gain faith, peace, or motion support, I want to let people know that there are other people we feel the same way and willing to help them with words. My idea is to design a platform that people can send and receive positive things from strangers.
        My most concern about the project is how to achieve this in a artist way. I think I will meet some technical issues.<div>
